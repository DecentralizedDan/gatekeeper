# Gatekeeper - Binary Counting Educational Web App

An interactive educational web application that teaches users about logical gates and binary counting through hands-on learning experiences.

## üéØ Project Overview

Gatekeeper is designed to make learning binary number representation engaging and accessible for users of all ages. The app provides a progressive learning experience, starting from basic concepts (0 and 1) and advancing to complex topics like signed vs unsigned integers.

## ‚ú® Features

### Interactive Learning

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with simple 1-bit numbers and advance to 8-bit signed integers
- **Click to Toggle**: Interactive binary digits that users can click to change between 0 and 1
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback with color-coded results
- **Retry Mechanism**: Users can continue trying until they get the correct answer

### Educational Progression

The app follows this learning sequence:

1. **Basic Concepts**: 0, 1 (1-bit numbers)
2. **Simple Binary**: 2, 4 (2-3 bit numbers)
3. **Medium Complexity**: 10, 100 (4-7 bit numbers)
4. **Advanced Concepts**: 128, 256 (8-bit numbers)
5. **Signed Numbers**: -1, -10, -128 (introducing negative values)

### User Experience

- **Clean, Modern Interface**: Simple, colorful design suitable for all ages
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of correct/incorrect answers with animations
